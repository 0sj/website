# my first finished project
### small personal page
this is my first personal project ive actually finished, an HTML (no css) page with my personal stuff, including some images i like, my contacts and socials, and a writeup on my personal skills, and goals im shooting for,

as you can see there isnt really that much and its a basic level of code, but im using this as a lauchpad for my future goals, and an initial step for my github page.
